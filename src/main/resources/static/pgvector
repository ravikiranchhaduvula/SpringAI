Postgres + pgvector: stores your text chunks as vectors (embeddings) + metadata.
Spring AI VectorStore (pgvector): API Spring uses to write/read vectors.
OpenAI Embeddings (text-embedding-3-small): turns text → numeric vectors.
Spring AI ChatClient: calls the LLM (e.g., gpt-4o-mini) to answer using retrieved context.

1) Ingest (POST /rag/ingest)
Input: { "id": "runbook-1", "text": "...", "meta": { ... } }
Controller calls RagService.ingest(id, text, meta).
VectorStore.add([...Document...]):
Spring AI asks OpenAI Embeddings to embed text.
Spring AI saves: content, embedding vector, and metadata (incl. your docId) into pgvector.
Table & vector column exist because spring.ai.vectorstore.pgvector.initialize-schema=true.

//Result: your snippet is now searchable by meaning, not just keywords.

2) Retrieve + answer (POST /rag/ask)

Input: { "q": "How do we reduce p95 latency in checkout?", "k": 3 }
Controller calls rag.retrieve(q, k) → VectorStore.similaritySearch(query, k).

Spring AI:
Embeds the query via OpenAI Embeddings.

Runs a cosine similarity search in pgvector to get top-k documents.

Controller formats a prompt:

System: “Answer using ONLY the provided context. If not in context, say ‘I don’t know’.”

User:

Question: <q>
Context:
- <doc1 content>
- <doc2 content>
- ...


ChatClient sends that to the model → gets a short answer.

Controller responds with:

{
  "answer": "...",
  "sources": [
    { "preview": "<first 160 chars>", "metadata": { "docId":"runbook-1", ... } },
    ...
  ]
}

The sources make the answer auditable.

3). Key behaviors & knobs

    Chunking (later): For real docs, split into ~500–1000-char chunks before ingest; better recall.

    Top-K (k): Start with 3; 3–5 is typical.

    Strictness: The system prompt forces answers only from context; unknown → “I don’t know”.

    Metadata: You can filter by metadata later (e.g., only service=checkout).

    Costs: Embeddings happen only on ingest (and for each query). Using text-embedding-3-small keeps it cheap.

 5) Where to plug RAG into the router (optional)

 In your /ai/route, before you call the model, do rag.retrieve(q, 2) and prepend the same Context block to your routing prompt.

 That lets routing decisions consider your local docs (e.g., invoice formats, internal policies).
